4. Limitations on copyright

Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the

5. Obligations of the Licensee

The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those
obligations are the following:

Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to
the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of this Licence with every copy of the
Work he/she distributes or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices
stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.

Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works, this
Distribution or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the
Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence — for example by communicating «EUPL v. 1.2
only». The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or
Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.

Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the
Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done under the
terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, «Compatible Licence» refers to the licences listed in the
appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her
obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.

Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work, or provide a link to a repository where this Source Code is easily
and freely accessible, for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.

Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of
the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing
the content of the copyright notice.

6. Chain of Authorship

The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed
to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or
licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their
contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous Contributors. It is not a finished work and may
present bugs, errors, inconsistencies, faults and other inaccuracies that the Licensee shall be aware of.

The Work is provided under the terms of this Licence on an «as is» basis and without warranties of any kind concerning
the Work, including without limitation merchantability, suitability for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors,
accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.

8. Disclaimer of Liability

Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be
liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the
Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of
data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the
Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.

9. Additional agreements

While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement, defining terms or conditions of use,
warranties, disclaimers, liability and/or other specific obligations of the parties and/or any other terms and conditions.
However, if accepting work, You may not act on behalf of the Licensor, except if the Licensor expressly agrees.

The additional agreement shall be made in writing and shall be annexed to the Licence. It shall be valid only if the
additional agreement does not contradict the terms of the Licence.

10. Acceptance of the Licence

The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon «I agree» placed under the bottom of a window
displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with rules of applicable
law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and
conditions.

by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution or
Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

11. Information to the public

In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by
offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at
least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way
it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.

12. Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of any term of
this Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the licences of the Licensee who have received the Work from the
Licensee under the Licence, however as long as the Licensee is in compliance with the Licence.

13. Miscellaneous

Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work.

If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or
enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be replaced or construed so as best to accomplish the
objectives of that invalid or unenforceable provision to the fullest extent possible under applicable law and the remainder
of the Licence will remain in full force and effect.

The Licence can be modified by the European Commission. All versions of the Licence will be numbered and, if the
Licensor has not specified a particular version of the Licence to apply, the Licensee can choose between the versions
published by the European Commission or any later versions published by the European Commission.
